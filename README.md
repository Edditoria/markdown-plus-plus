# Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++

Default or Zenburn, your choice! :)

By default, Notepad++ doesn't provide syntax highlighting for Markdown.  
I use them everyday, and I'm using a dark theme called Zenburn.  
So, I make one for myself, and share to the world.

If you are a Notepad++ and Markdown user, you may like it!

Supports file extensions: `.markdown` and `.md`  
Tested: Notepad++ v6.8.8 (Windows 7)

p\.s\. I also created *Coffeescript syntax highlighting*:  
[link][coffeescript] (for Zenburn theme only)

## How to Use?

1. Download the Markdown language definition file
     - **Zenburn Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown_zenburn.xml][zenburn_xml]
     - **Default Theme** : [userDefineLang_markdown.xml][default_xml]
2. In Notepad++ menu, click `Language` and select `Define your language...` .
3. In User Defined Language windows, click `Import` then open the xml file.
4. Restart Notepad++.
5. Open and test with a CoffeeScript file e.g. [test.md][test_file]

**Enjoy!!**
