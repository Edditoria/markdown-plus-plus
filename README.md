# Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++

Default or Zenburn, your choice! :)

By default, Notepad++ doesn't provide syntax highlighting for Markdown.  
I use them everyday, and I'm using a dark theme called Zenburn.  
So, I make one for myself, and share to the world.

If you are a Notepad++ and Markdown user, you may like it!

Supports file extensions: `.markdown` and `.md`  
Tested: Notepad++ v6.2 (Windows)

I also created *Coffeescript syntax highlighting*:  
[link][coffeescript] (only Zenburn)

## How to Use?

You need to modify a file `userDefineLang.xml` in your Notepad++ program folder.  

1. Download the Markdown language definition file
     - **Zenburn Theme** : [userDefineLang.xml](zenburn_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
     - **Default Theme** : [userDefineLang.xml](default_theme/userDefineLang.xml)
2. Find out your Notepad++ program folder/directory.
3. There may be a file called `userDefineLang.xml`
     - If it does _not_ already exist, copy the XML file to the folder.
     - If it _does_ exist, you need to edit your xml file manually:
       - open the active `userDefineLang.xml` with a text editor.
       - Copy the contents of the Markdown definition file between the `<UserLang...></UserLang>` tags into the active `userDefineLang.xml`, at the end right before `</NotepadPlus>`.
       - Save `userDefineLang.xml`.
4. Restart Notepad++.

**Enjoy!!**
